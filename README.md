# IGD Game Repository - Group A

The game is a 2D action side-scroller with working Kinect controls. The executable file of the game can be found in the game_exe folder at the root of the directory.

## Quickstart

 - First of all, install Git LFS to be able to clone the repository correctly (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage)

```bash

# clone project

git clone https://git.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/6bruland/igdss24-groupa.git

cd IGDSS24-GroupA

```

- Next download the Unity launcher and an instance of the version 2022.3.14f1
- Try starting the project like this, if a message box regarding the safety mode appears, ignore it and start the project up anyways

Finally install the following asset packages, to make sure that all of the required files are present:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-asset-2d-handcrafted-art-117049

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/pixel-dark-forest-136825

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/pixel-fantasy-caves-152375

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/platformer-fantasy-set1-159063

In case a scene is buggy, manually download the scene file and its .meta file from the repository (under Assets/Scenes) and replace them with the local files on your machine.
